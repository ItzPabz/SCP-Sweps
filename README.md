# Pabz's SCP SWeps GitHub

Hey, thanks for checking out my GitHub. Here you can find all of my SCP SWeps. I've always thought that SCP SWeps on servers or either unusable, clunky, or just downright awful. A lot of servers that I see continue to use the exact same SWeps, so I decided to have a **different option**. So that servers didn't have to break the piggy bank, for custom ones, or continue to use the old ones. **I hope you enjoy!!**

## Modifying Files
If you know a little bit of gLua and wish to build off of my SWeps or modify them to your liking go ahead and do so, however, I have **two rules for** those **editing** my SWeps:

1.  Do not charge people for a modified version of my SWeps.
2.  Do not remove my name from the author tag. Simply add your name onto it.
